# Click Clack
# Click Clack Game (Tech Edition)


<div>

```html

    Welcome to my Click Game; with this assignment we were asked to create a guessing game that will have you selecting images/icons off of a grid. Your goal is to only select each image one time and not to repeat your selection. But be careful as the tech icons with redomize with each click. 
    
    Best of luck!
    
    Please enjoy!

Instructions


Check out the example solution and study the app's basic functionality.
Create a new React application using Create React App.
The application should render different images (of your choice) to the screen. Each image should listen for click events.
The application should keep track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.
Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.
Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.
When complete, the application should be deployed to Github Pages. See the README generated with Create React App for instructions on deploying the application to Github Pages.
